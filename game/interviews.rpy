    ben "Dr. Dorian, your theory of the Origami Effect is supposed to eventually bring  about a new chapter in the efficiency of space travel. How did you develop this theory?"    

    scientist "The theory of folding space time upon itself is not a new concept.{w} However, I have conceptualized a testable hypothesis that would allow us to - theoretically - fold space over on itself and then punch through the \"surface\" of the universe creating a hole that leads to another location in space, often called a wormhole."
    scientist "Similar to origami, this can be used multiple times making several distant places in space seem much closer by folding space as you would fold a piece of paper.{w} Thus making it possible to travel to distant locations rapidly."

    ben "That sounds like a rather bold concept. Are there any plans in the works to actually test and implement this concept or is this simply a grand theory?"

    scientist "It's a hypothesis Ben.{w} Though feasibly testable it isn't testable with the current state of technology today.{w} I do not forsee any breakthroughs in the implementation of my hypothesis, but hope to see it proved a theory in my life time.{w} As a project like this would require large venture capital to take interest in the concept of lowering the cost of transportation.{w} Unfortunately, at this point I don't think any one would be willing to put forth the capital needed to see this in practice."

    ben "So then you are telling me that at this point, it has no practicale uses?"

    scientist "No. That is not what I am saying at all. I am just saying it would be very expensive to attempt now, but say 10 years in the future, following current technology trends, it should be much more affordable."

    ben "So, Doctor assuming your hypothesis is eventually proven, there are warnings in the scientific community that a device implemented using your theory could be used to coagulate celestial bodies into one giant mass,{w} creating the theoretical conditions for an synthetic black hole.{w} What then, if instead of funding a new transportation method, funding was provided to utilize the origami effect hypothesis in a weapon?"

    scientist "Ha! Even if someone did manage to implement my hypothesis any time soon - much less weaponize it - the ammount of energy it would take to, fold space over and over until enough celestial bodies are positioned to significantly attract each other gravitaionally to produce a black hole, is tremendous.{w} So, at present, the answer to your question is: it is impossible!"
