    ben "Dr. Dorian, it sounds like your work could start a new chapter for space travel. Could you summarize your theory for me?"

    scientist "It's a hypothesis, Ben."

    ben "Well, yeah. Tell me about your hypothesis then..."

    scientist "Sure. Don't fall for the hype, the concept of folding space time is not new.{w} However, the bulk of my work puts forth a hypothesis that is testable far sooner than previous scientific models.{w} We might even be able to do small scale tests right now, which is why NeoGenesis has already secured the rights to my work, for a royalty of course."
    scientist "Folding space time requires exponential energy meaning the bigger the fold the more energy per meter needed to make the fold.{w} My hypothesis calls for many little folds that cover the same distance as a big fold, which is much more manageable.{w} You can read my thesis for the details, but basically it is similar to origami with space time instead of paper.{w} Thus making it possible to travel many lightyears in the blink of an eye with much less energy than previously thought."

    ben "I think the implications on transportation are obvious and it may be some time before we see it practically affecting our transportation systems.{w} However, many technologies have been implemented swiftly due to their value as a weapon.{w} What do you think about the warnings in the scientific community that a device using this origami effect could be used as a weapon of unprecedented destruction?"

    scientist "Ha! Even if someone did manage to weaponize the origami effect it wouldn't be very precise. We're talking about taking out a star system as one of its smallest targets. Then take into consideration the amount of energy required...{w} more convnentional weapons are probably better suited to the task, though yes it could be \"weaponized\" to coagulate celestial bodies to a single point."

    ben "Interesting.{w} Well I've got what I was interested in writing my article about.{w} Thank you for your time Dr. Dorian."

    scientist "Glad I could help. Let me know if you need further clarification."

    ben "Thanks, will do."

    traitor "Of course, Ben, we merely perform legal inspections on genesis gates.{w} What we've found might be surprising though.{w} It seems that their engineering efforts lowered the energy required to cause the origami effect for transportation, yet they're still using near the theoretical energy levels, while also not increasing the distance between their 'gates'."

    traitor "Don't let Chad Hewett's charm fool you.{w} The genesis gate incident was a cover up for testing the genesis gate's potential as a weapon.{w} We just can't definitively prove it because...{w} well the evidence is gone and with the rumors of it being a sabotage with CPC being a suspect it's difficult to get close to any genesis gates to see if they too have the same or better potential for that matter as a weapon."
